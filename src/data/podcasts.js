The podcast started with John Sonmez and Iris Classon in 2013, two experienced developers as well as fitness geeks. In 2015 Robert Navarro started hosting the podcast after John Sonmez handed him the keys to the castle and allowed him to continue the tradition of helping others reach both their fitness and career goals. In this podcast they share all they know about getting in shape, losing weight, gaining muscle and eating right in their weekly discussion about all things fitness and nutrition. Want to know how to really get those 6 pack abs? Are carbs really bad for you? John and Iris answer all these questions and more in this short weekly podcast with about fitness and nutrition from engineering minds. Here is a short sampling for some of the topics discussed in this podcast:: fitness, nutrition, software development, programming, muscle, weight training, lifting, running, 5ks, marathons, jogging, workout, health, healthy living, aerobics, weight loss, exercise, diet, motivation.",
