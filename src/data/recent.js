And I said that along the way you&#8217;d get to watch and learn as I learned directly from my heroes. We did it. \nA thousand interviews later here I am today bringing back some of the most memorable and most influential interviewees. People who helped me both on camera here with you and off. I invited them on to a Google Hangout to talk about the old days, to ask them some new questions and to do short interviews with them all for you. That&#8217;s what this is all about. My goal when I started out was to build a successful company. I think Mixergy is that company. But I wanted to be even more successful.

I hunt down information that you can use because I&#8217;m passionate about helping you build a business that your great-great-grandkids would admire you for.\nThat&#8217;s why I kept digging in this interview. I want you (and me too, frankly) to be able to produce the kind of hits that Seth Godin keeps cranking out, seemingly without breaking a sweat. Not only has Seth created 2 big hit businesses, but he&#8217;s a writer who keeps introducing ideas that shape the way people think.\nIn his new book, Linchpin, Seth talks about how to be this prolific. As you&#8217;ll hear in my interview, much of it is based on opening up your creativity and learning how to confront your fears, which he says come from your &#8220;lizard brain.&#8221; Imagine what you could accomplish if you were able to do that. Listen to the full program to find out how.\nSeth Godin&#8217;s latest book is Linchpin. You can buy it here or see what others say about it on this Squidoo lens. He also writes the world&#8217;s most popular marketing blog. And is the founder of Squidoo.\n&nbsp;\nMore interviews -&gt; https://mixergy.com/moreint\nRate this interview -&gt; https://mixergy.com/rateint",

Today, we take two of those fictional representations and bring them to life.&nbsp;&nbsp;\nMike Belsito has ventured out to find several real life personas, interview them and bring you what we've found. How accurate are our personas? What are we often missing from them that would help us build better products?&nbsp;\nA persona typically has a name, a picture, relevant characteristics such as age or income group, behavioural traits, common tasks, and a goal that describes the problem the persona wants to see solved or the benefit the character wants to achieve. This information is traditionally based on direct observation, interviews, and other qualitative&nbsp;market research.\nPersonas should help you&nbsp;develop empathy&nbsp;for your&nbsp;users and customers. They encourage you&nbsp;to embrace a&nbsp;user-centred&nbsp;approach:&nbsp;Putting the users first, and building a product that that truly benefits&nbsp;them. This&nbsp;avoids the fallacy of a solution-centric approach: worrying more about the product and its features and technologies than the reason people would want to buy and use it in the first place.\nAlan Cooper pioneered &nbsp;personas in product development in the 1990ies. Today every product manager and product owner should be able to create and work with personas.",

                "description": " Rob and Jason are joined by Dr. Greg Law from Undo to talk about the magic of reverse debugging and how it is becoming more widely known in the programming community.     Greg is the co-founder and CEO of Undo. He is a coder at heart, but likes to bridge the gap between the business and software worlds. (Sadly, these days most of Greg's coding is done on aeroplanes.)  Greg has 20 years’ experience in the software industry and has held development and management roles at companies including the pioneering British computer firm Acorn, as well as fast-growing start ups, NexWave and Solarflare. It was at Acorn that Greg met Julian and on evenings and weekends, they invented the core technology that would eventually become UndoDB. Greg left Solarflare in 2012 to lead Undo as CEO and has overseen the company as it transitioned from the shed in his back garden to a scalable award-winning business.  Greg holds a PhD from City University, London, that was nominated for the 2001 British Computer Society Distinguished Dissertation Award. He lives in Cambridge, UK with his wife and two children and in his spare time, catches up on email.

Over the past few years, Corey has greatly influenced the deals that Ian has made, and he has helped save Ian thousands of dollars. \n\nOn this week's episode, Corey shares his stories, tips, and strategies about what it takes to make killer deals.\n\nThese tips don't just apply to car sales, either. We believe that anyone that's listening to this episode can learn something that can help them make a deal and that learning these techniques can help you make great strides along your entrepreneurial journey. ",

Using the skills he learned during his apprenticeship, he left to become an SEO consultant and ultimately started his own successful productized business called FatCat Apps. \n\nDavid joins us on this week's show to talk about three specific life scripts that are uniquely tailored for entrepreneurs. \n\nThese scripts will help us to create the kind of financial independence that will ultimately allow us to live the kind of lives that we want, on our own terms.",

Entrepreneurs frequently feel like they have no idea what they are doing or what they are supposed to do.\n\nChris Cage first joined us on the TropicalMBA in 2015 to talk to about his company, Greenbelly Meals.

Your background is very well documented, so maybe give us a little glimpse into your latest company - Synadia Communications. \nTopic 2 - (Public) Cloud Computing has grown in lock-step with the growth of the smartphone (since 2007), creating a specific pattern of application/communication and data collection. What are the forces that are driving all the attention around the Edge Computing evolution (e.g. sensors, smart cars, peer-to-peer patterns, etc.)?\nTopic 3 - What do the economics of Edge Computing look like today? Where are the big bottlenecks, or areas for big disruption? Does it vary widely depending on the application (e.g. sensor data vs. streaming vs. telemetry) , or geography (e.g. dense cities, transportation networks, rural areas, etc.)\nTopic 4 - You’ve talked about the Google Brain project for a long time. We’ve seen growth around centralized AI/ML for the last 5-7 years. Do you expect a different mode of AI/ML that has to emerge because Edge Computing patterns will be significantly different than centralized models, or do they need small adaptations? \nTopic 5 - You’ve need heavily involved with messaging technologies over the years, from TIBCO to NATS. Can you share some insight into how messaging (or async communications) that might need to evolve at the edge, in more distributed types of systems? \n\n\n\n\nFeedback?\n\nEmail: show at thecloudcast dot net\nTwitter: @thecloudcastnet and <a href='https://twitter.com/Serverl",

Let’s discuss what that means.\nTopic 3 - “The result is an application that is “smart,” but exceptionally data-intensive and computationally expensive”. What are the problems this creates on today’s infrastructure?\nTopic 4 - “For ML/AI to reach its full potential, it must graduate from the academic discipline it is today into an engineering one. What that means in practice is that there needs to be new abstractions, interfaces, systems, and tooling to make developing and deploying intelligent applications easy for developers.” - Give us some of the first steps that will make this happen.\nTopic 5 - As a VC, you’re in the business of finding the companies that might turn this into a reality.

So where are we?\nTopic 2 - The DevOps community seemed to want to reject all sort of labels and titles (DevOps engineer, DevOps certified, etc.) and how there is this “SRE” (Site Reliability Engineering) concept. Is this just a new name for DevOps?\nTopic 3 - Like NetFlix had microservices, so everybody needed microservices - Google has SRE, so now everyone needs SRE? How does SRE fit into a non-Google company? \nTopic 4 - Many Infra/Ops-centric people have been trying to learn automation and some basic programming (e.g. Python, Powershell/Scripting). SREs are often described as programmers that live in the Ops world.

You’ve been at Chef for a couple years now, and previously at Docker (and several other emerging tech companies).

How has that transition been and what motivated you to make the change?\nTopic 3 - About a year ago, Chef introduced Habitat, which was a fairly large “re-think” from the previous Chef platforms, which was more focused on SysAdmin / Ops teams. Give you give the audience an overview on Habitat, for anyone that’s not familiar with the basic concepts?\nTopic 4 - Sometimes people will say that the existing Config Management tools are no longer needed now that we have containers, since they describe everything within their tools / files. How might you respond to those types of arguments? \nTopic 5 - A few weeks ago Chef introduced Habitat Builder. How does this differ from Habitat?\nTopic 6 - We see that Habitat is now supporting integration with platforms like Cloud Foundry and Kubernetes. How are you seeing the uptake of those platforms in the market, or what’s driving their adoption?\nTopic 7 - As you’re engaging with more companies that are building Cloud Native applications, what are some of the things they do that make them successful with these new apps, new operational models, new types of IT cultures? \n\n\n\n\nFeedback?\n\nEmail: show at thecloudcast dot net\nTwitter: @thecloudcastnet and @ServerlessCast\n",

Where are we on the maturity curve of AI and ML?\nTopic 4 - What are some of the key technology elements that people should be aware of with AI and ML? Do we make a mistake by mentioning them today (e.g. AI and ML), and are they very different?\nTopic 5 - Can we talk about data and data models/set and data gravity as it relates to AI and ML? Do you bring the data to the engine, or the engine to the data? How do companies deal with this today?\nTopic 6 - AI and ML also have the ability to have major societal impacts on our work, from jobs to human privacy to better access to healthcare or studying global warming.

We explored this earlier with Gerry Katz in episode 071. It was an episode several listeners really appreciated and I have invited Gerry back to share more of his expert experience with market research. Specifically, he discusses market research mistakes product managers too often make, including:\nConfusing qualitative with quantitative research.Talking to the wrong customers.Asking customers what they want.Not separating needs from solutions to needs.Translating customer vernacular into company-speak.Hearing only what you want to hear.",

This also ranks as most important out of all the reasons for being a product manager. Does that ring true for you as well?\n\nProduct managers with more influence are able to accomplish more — creating better products for customers that they value. Product managers with less influence may be treated like gophers — asked to go do this or go do that. Such product managers are more reactive than proactive. If you are like me, there is little that sounds fun or rewarding about that. Indeed, we need influence.\n\nTo help us get it, I invited Tom Henschel back. He joined us in episode 137 to share a tool for talking like a leader, which is part of increasing your influence. This time he shared a model for having more influence called the Five Influence Strategies.\n\nIn the discussion, you’ll learn how to use the components of this strategy, which are:\nBuild credibilityInvolve people activelyFrame ideas for themPresent compelling evidenceCustomize your communication",

It allows them to test ideas and solve problems that would be considered too small or risky by GE Appliance.\n\nThey have built a platform that is fueled by an open community of consumers and problem solvers.\n\nWhat would happen if that capability was used by other companies to tackle any type of product concept? That is what Taylor Dawson is discovering. When I talked with him in episode 110 he was the Product Evangelist for First Build. Now he is the CEO of Giddy, who is providing a First Build capability to any large company. That is like being able to create a successful innovation lab overnight without actually building one.\n\nThis also means that Giddy will be deepening and rapidly increasing their own learning started at First Build. That makes them the leader for the rest of us to learn from.\n\nSpecifically, in this discussion you will discover:\nWhy it’s important but almost impossible for large organizations to innovate like a startup.The advantages of an open innovation lab.What makes the FirstBuild innovation lab a success — which are ideas to help your organization be more innovative.The benefits of leveraging Giddy for increasing product success.",

We do that by providing customers value. The source of that value may be, and perhaps should be, closer to our core capabilities than is often thought. The toy company LEGO found this to be true, only after being on the brink of bankruptcy. Other companies have also discovered this principle, which is something my guest calls innovating near the core.\n\nMy guest this week, David Robertson, explored this in a book-long case study of LEGO, called Brick by Brick:  How LEGO Rewrote the Rules of Innovation and Conquered the Global Toy Industry. In his recent book, The Power of Little Ideas: A Low-Risk, High-Reward Approach to Innovation, he studies other companies who have won their market using a similar approach.\n\nDavid is a Senior Lecturer at the MIT Sloan School of Management, where he teaches Innovation and Product Design. He is also the host of the weekly radio show on SiriusXM called “Innovation Navigation,” where he interviews world-renowned thought leaders about the management of innovation.\n\nIn the discussion, you’ll learn:\nWhy almost all of LEGO’s product innovation efforts resulted in millions of dollars lost.What action turned LEGO around and produced growth.How companies have innovated close to their core to create market success.",

Failures are frequent — around 40% or so depending on the industry — and they happen at small companies, big companies, and experienced companies, including Pepsi.\n\nIn this episode, you’ll learn a simple and profound concept that every product manager and product marketer must understand. And, this is an easy one to get wrong. Even Pepsi got this wrong when they created a new product called Crystal Pepsi.\n\nThe simple part of the concept — don’t confuse your customer.\n\nThe profound part — when introducing something new or making a change, give your customer a reason.\n\nMy guest to explain this concept is Kyle B. Murray, the Vice Dean and Professor of Marketing at the Alberta School of Business. Kyle studies human judgment and decision making. His research uses the tools of experimental psychology and behavioral economics to better understand the choices that consumers make.\n\nHe is a co-author of an article explaining the mistake Pepsi made with Crystal Pepsi. When I read the article I recognized how important the concept is to product managers and contacted with Kyle to tell us about it himself.\n\nIn the discussion you will learn the:\nReason people didn’t purchase Crystal Pepsi.Solution to the issue so you don’t make the same mistake.Examples demonstrating the solution.",

If it’s not yet true for you, virtual meetings are almost certainly in your future as more teams become virtual.\n\nFacilitating virtual meetings and making them productive takes specific skills that product managers should know.

He described himself as a “newbie” with about one-year of experience. He has been struggling to learn what the role of product manager was really about. After trying a few different approaches to learning more, he took a very creative path. He decided to interview 30 expert product managers and create a virtual summit of the insights shared on the interviews. This would help him rapidly learn and provide an opportunity for other younger product managers to do the same. I thought it was a great idea since my work is all about helping product managers know what they really need to know. So, I eagerly accepted his invitation to be part of his Product Manager Summit.\n\nMore recently, I was discussing his experience as a product manager and what he had learned so far. \n",

Also, post-processing capabilities, such as metal-plating plastic printed parts, are creating new opportunities for ergonomically correct parts. 3D printing provides significant efficiencies and competitive advantages.\n\nI discussed the state of 3D printing and additive manufacturing with industry veteran John Bailotti.

While it does not directly deal with product management concepts, it does deal with success concepts. The upcoming discussion is about a book The Muse called the number-one best career book available. The book is Insight: Why We’re Not as Self-Aware as We Think, and How Seeing Ourselves Clearly Helps Us Succeed at Work and in Life.\n\nI discussed the key concepts of being more self-aware with Insight author, Dr. Tasha Eurich. Tasha is an organizational psychologist, researcher, and New York Times best-selling author. She has helped thousands of leaders and teams improve their effectiveness through greater self-awareness. In the interview she shares two categories of self-awareness and how we can be more self-aware.\n\nIt’s an important topic because greater self-awareness means greater success.

My short answer is that executives and senior leaders want product managers to be thinking and acting more strategically towards the objectives of the organization. However, there are a lot of specifics to discuss, and this interview does that. My guest structures the discussion around three stages of organizational growth, which he calls the early stage, adolescent, and well-established. What executives need from product managers differs with each stage.\n\nSharing these insights with us is Scott Propp, a former Fortune 100 executive and all around product guy. Today he serves organizations on a short-term basis, helping the executive team identify the right high-value product opportunities that yield the maximum return.\n",

Executives overwhelmingly point to innovation as the growth engine for their organizations yet actual innovation performance is underwhelming. There are several factors contributing to the issue and one of them is the way innovation is led. The reality is that most organizational leaders don’t really understand innovation or know how to lead it.\n\nWell, that is about to change with this interview. The Center for Creative Leadership conducts original research, with findings to help leaders be more effective. New research conducted by Mike Mitchell found that leading innovation requires a different approach to leadership. This research explains what leaders need to do to effectively lead innovation.\n\nMike joins me to discuss what is needed to lead innovation and what product managers need to know as well.\n\nMike has a Ph.D. in Industrial Psychology with a focus on Organizational Leadership. His focus is on what it takes to successfully contribute to, and lead, innovation in an organization. He is a senior faculty member at the Center for Creative Leadership.\n",
